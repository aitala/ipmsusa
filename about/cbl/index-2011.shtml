          manufactured plastic model kits, and to provide information, data, and 
          other assistance to such members to continually raise the standards and 
          techniques of their work.</li>
        <li>To ensure timely exchange of modeling information while 
          guarding against the compromise of commercial planning and to ensure 
          that the modelers' correspondence or discussion is not directed into 
          areas of national security.</li>
        <li>To provide for the members' interests by keeping them informed 
          through the Society's publications of new products and services. Members 
          will also be warned of unscrupulous practices within the industry, by 
          private individuals, or by fellow members.</li>

      <p> <strong>The objectives of this organization are:</strong></p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>To publish at regularly established intervals a magazine of 
          interest to<br>
          the majority of the membership on plastic modeling and related subjects, 
          including current information pertaining to the hobby and associated 
          industries.</li>
        <li>To establish, maintain, and provide an information service for 
          the benefit of the membership.</li>
        <li>To encourage interest in plastic modeling and assist 
          interested organizations and groups.</li>
        <li>To establish and maintain liaison with manufacturers of 
          products associated with the modeling hobby where possible.</li>
        <li>To establish and maintain liaison with foreign IPMS branches.</li>
